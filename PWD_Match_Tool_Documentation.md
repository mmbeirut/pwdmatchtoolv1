# PWD Match Tool v5 - User Guide

## What This Tool Does
The PWD Match Tool helps immigration lawyers find similar job cases that have already been approved by the Department of Labor. When you have a new job position that needs a wage determination, this tool searches through thousands of previously approved cases to find the ones most similar to your new job.

## How to Use This Tool

### 1. Enter Your Job Information
You can fill out details about the job position you're working on:

**Basic Job Information**:
- Job Title: What the position is called
- Job Description: What the person will actually do in this job
- Company: Which employer is offering the job
- Location: Where the job is located (city and state)
- Salary Range: How much the job pays

**Education Requirements**:
- Required Education: The minimum degree needed for the job
- Alternate Education: Other acceptable education levels

**Experience Requirements**:
- Required Experience: The minimum work experience needed
- Alternate Experience: Other acceptable experience levels

**Additional Requirements**:
- Occupation Requirements: Special qualifications needed for this type of work
- Special Skills: Technical skills or certifications required
- Alternate Special Skills: Other acceptable skills

### 2. Filter Your Search (Optional)
Before searching, you can narrow down which cases to look through:

- **Companies**: Only look at cases from specific employers
- **Locations**: Only look at jobs in certain cities or states
- **Job Titles**: Only look at specific types of positions
- **Case Status**: Only look at cases with certain approval statuses

You can use multiple filters at the same time to get more focused results.

### 3. How the Tool Finds Matches
The tool compares your job to existing cases using six different factors:

**What Gets Compared** (and how much each factor matters):
- Education requirements (15% of the score)
- Work experience requirements (15% of the score)
- Job duties and occupation requirements (15% of the score)
- Required skills (20% of the score)
- Job title and description (15% of the score)
- Work location (20% of the score)

**Education Matching**: The tool understands that a Master's degree is higher than a Bachelor's degree, which is higher than a high school diploma. It gives the best scores when education levels match exactly, and lower scores when they don't match well.

**Smart Text Comparison**: The tool can understand that "software developer" and "programmer" are similar jobs, even if the exact words are different. It looks at the meaning behind the words, not just exact word matches.

### 4. Understanding Your Results
After searching, you'll get a list of similar cases ranked from most similar to least similar.

**Match Strength Levels**:
- **Strong Match**: 80% or higher similarity - These cases are very similar to your job
- **Moderate Match**: 60-79% similarity - These cases are somewhat similar
- **Weak Match**: 40-59% similarity - These cases have some similarities
- **Very Weak Match**: Less than 40% similarity - These cases are not very similar

**What You'll See for Each Match**:
- Case number from the Department of Labor
- Company name and job title
- Where the job is located
- Complete job description
- Education and experience requirements
- Special skills needed
- How similar it is to your job (percentage and category)
- Wage information and any potential wage issues
- Whether the case was approved
- When the approval is valid

### 5. Wage Comparison
The tool automatically checks if your job's salary is appropriate:

- **Wage Sources**: Shows where the approved wage came from (government surveys, union agreements, etc.)
- **Wage Issues**: Warns you if your job's salary might be too low compared to the approved case
- **Wage Information**: Shows the approved wage amount for comparison

### 6. What Makes This Tool Helpful

**Saves Time**: Instead of manually searching through thousands of cases, the tool finds relevant matches in seconds.

**Finds Hidden Connections**: The tool can find similar cases even when the job titles or descriptions use different words.

**Comprehensive Comparison**: Looks at multiple aspects of each job, not just the title or one requirement.

**Detailed Breakdown**: Shows exactly why each case is similar or different from your job.

**Quality Control**: Automatically checks for potential wage issues and provides detailed case information.

### 7. System Features

**Reliability**: The tool keeps working even if some parts have problems, falling back to simpler matching methods when needed.

**Data Safety**: Handles missing information gracefully and processes various data formats.

**Performance**: Limits results to the top 50 matches to keep the tool running quickly.

**Accuracy**: Uses advanced text analysis to understand job similarities beyond simple word matching.
